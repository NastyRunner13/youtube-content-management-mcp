      "Hi everyone. So if you take a look atthis chart, what you would notice isthat if you invested $100 in large capChina market, okay, so large capcompanies in China in the year 2007,that $100 would have remained $100 upuntil now. So roughly 18 years and youwould have made 0% returns. Now theinteresting part is that back in 20078also China was growing really fast. Eventoday it is growing really fast. Peopleare very excited about the Chineseeconomy that you know what it's going toovertake US. But is this the right timeto invest in Chinese stocks? That's thequestion. Why is it that the Chinesestock market does not give returns? Ifyou understand this last 20 30 yearhistory, compare it to the Indianmarket, US market, you will get a sensewhether you should be overinvested inChina or not right now. So I'm going tobreak down this complex research complextopic for you. It is going to be veryinsightful if you watch it till the veryend. And also a very quick request thatapproximately 60% of the viewers whowatch this channel, they do notsubscribe to the channel. In case youare benefiting from my commentary, doconsider subscribing. My videos willstart featuring on your feed then,right? So from that note please considersubscribing and we will start. Okay. Sofirst key point as to why the Chinesestock market does not give returns. Youneed to first understand why is it thata stock market gives returns. And thereare four key reasons why a stock marketwould give return. The first key reasonis more around macroeconomics. Forexample, the US stock market gives a lotof returns because it is the netexporter of US dollars. Right? So whencountries are actually buying the USdollar in a way or getting access to USdollars, they have to go and investsomewhere. The second key reason why astock market gives returns is becausethe government wants it to give returns.Okay, so this is two. I'll again explainthis. Number three is that privateinvestors get an exit. So privateinvestors for example Jane Street, youwould have seen that it's a companybased in the US but it does trading inthe Indian stock market. Why? Becausethey are getting a return on theircapital. Indian stock market islucrative for James tree. Therefore,they come and invest money from atrading point of view. So that is thethird key reason. Fourth reason is thatthe domestic investors keep pushing themarket or domestic investor consider themarket to be lucrative. So let's analyzethe Chinese stock market from these fourlenses. And if you see value across anyof these or a combination of these fourfactors, then you could potentiallybuild some positions in the China marketor you can figure out a better marketthat I'll speak along on this video.Okay. So let's go through it and firstand foremost let us understand themacroeconomics reason as to why acertain stock market gives returns froma macroeconomic viewpoint. Okay. So theeasiest example that I can use is the USmarket or US stock market for example.Now for decades the US stock market hasbeen doing exceptionally well. In factif you go and study like tech stocks inthe US the last 20 year outperformerfrom an index point of view is somethingcalled as QQQ or NASDAQ. Okay. Now thishas significantly beaten even the Indianmarket. For example, in dollar termsover the last 10 years, the averageCAGGR for QQQ has been 15.5%.But for the Indian market, it's muchlower. And now some of you woulddisagree that you know, okay fine,you're saying that Indian market gavelike 12%. But this 12% is an INR terms.Okay. So you have to adjust it to USdollar. So on an average in the last 10years INR has fallen by roughly 4% everyyear compared to US dollar. So thisreturn is eight. And for the US stockmarket or US tech index it's 15.5%. Sonatural question comes that hey you knowwhat why is it that QQQ or US stockmarkets be it S&P 500 or Dow Jones theyhave been doing well. Okay the reasonlie in macroeconomics and you have tounderstand it on three different points.Okay. So the first key point is or thelarger point that you need to understandis that the US exports something rightand it is called as US dollar export.Why? Because the share of US dollar inthe world trade is more than 60%. In theforex area right the US dollar share ismore than 85%. So that's how dominant USdollar is. So long story short, USdollar is the reserve currency of theworld and the number one export that theUS has is the US dollar. Right? Now whatis it that US wants? Okay, US hasabsolute power in terms of printing theUS dollar. They keep on printing it.They have complete control over theprinting of US dollar. The US governmentwill not come to you and say that youknow what okay can I print like more USdollars please? No, they can printwhatever the hell they like. Okay. Nowwhat is the primary benefit for the USto do this? Well, it allows by printingUS dollars, it allows the US to consumethings cheaply. Okay? And therefore, USis the best consumer market in theworld. Now, you'll say, \"No, that'sIndia.\" See, India volume wise, yes,India is huge. China is huge. But onprofit basis, right, on per customerbasis, US market is the most lucrativemarket in the world. Right? Now, what isthe meaning of import? So for example,let's say that US is paying China $100billion, okay? In the year 2025. So theyare giving China this hundred billion USdollar. And what is US getting inreturn? Well, they are getting a bunchof toys, bunch of clothes, bunch ofelectronics, bunch of differentdifferent things. So China ends upgetting what? Well, China ends upgetting a lot of US dollars. This 100billion worth. What does the US get?Well, US gets a lot of cheap consumergoods so to say. So, China also wins. USalso wins. Now, what would China do withthis? Well, China can buy US denominatedassets. For example, Chinese governmentis one of the biggest buyers of USbonds. Chinese buyers buy a lot of USstocks. Chinese buyers also buy propertyin Southeast Asia like examples beingrecent examples being Cambodia. So a lotof Chinese people are buying Cambodianreal estate. So this is happening atscale. The point being or the largerpoint macroeconomically being that US isa net importer of goods. China is a netexporter of goods. So the conditionsthat emerge due to this trade deficiencyis that China has to go and acquire USdenominated assets. And the only reasonwhy they will go and acquire USdenominated assets like US bonds or USstocks is because Chinese investors feelthat US assets are going to go up invalue. Now what does this lead to? Well,this leads to a lot of pros and cons.Pros becomes that US is able to consumea lot of things cheap. So that's oneadvantage for the US. Second pro becomethat US can print lot more of itscurrency and deflate the value ofeverything in the world. So that's thesecond key advantage. it has now becauseof this dollar dominance and in theirpursuit of maintaining this dollardominance they have to give exit toChinese investors right so the dynamicsthat get created is that China wants toremain an exporter of goods and USbecomes an importer of good now let'sflip the case let's think that what ifChina becomes an importer of good whathappens then well then China will haveto give other countries from which it isimporting so let's Okay, now US isexporting goods to China. Now China willgive 100 billion yuan to the US. Nowwhat will US do with it? Now can UScitizens go and buy like Chinese realestate? Can they go and buy Chinesestocks? Can they go and buy Chinesebonds? Well, they can if the governmentallows them to. So then comes the secondpoint that why will China allow or notallow foreigners to come and invest inChina. Now in order to study thisquestion you need to understand theconcept of foreign wealth that the goalof every country on earth is to bringforeign wealth. Now this has happenedeven when the Britishers used to ruleIndia. What was the goal of Britishers?Well, it was to bring India's wealthinto the US. How did they used to do it?Well, they used to manufacture shirts inManchester, sell it in India, take themoney out or gold out of India.Similarly, if we go to the gold age ofIndia, what did India used to do? Well,India used to export a lot of stuff.What does export means that okay we willsell like silk or whatever it is andthen we will sell it in like whateverEurope etc and someone will pay us goldwe will bring that gold to India but inmodern times like 2025 the governmentneeds to decide the focus or the assetthrough which they want to bring foreignwealth for example if you go and studyUAE and more specifically Dubai what isDubai government trying to do well it istrying to bring a lot of foreigninvestors into Dubai real estate so theDubai government has structured lawsDubai government has made investing inDubai properties fairly easy, simplebecause they want foreign money orforeign wealth to come to Dubai via realestate. But have you seen people inDubai getting very excited about UAEstocks? Not right now, right? Not manypeople know about it. According to me,it's a dark horse. Maybe we'll speakabout it on some other video. But longstory short, this is an importantconcept or powerful concept that youneed to understand. Now you need to aska very simple question that how doesChina bring foreign wealth into theircountry? Well, again going back to theprevious discussion that China is a netexporter. A net exporter of what? A netexporter of a lot of things. And arethey importing a lot? Yes, they areimporting but they're constantly runningsomething called as trade surplus whichmeans that every year they export morecompared to import. And what does thatallow them to do? Well, it allows themto bring foreign wealth. Now is thatsomething that India is able to do? Theshort answer is no. We are trying tobring foreign wealth through our stockmarkets. Why? Because unlike Dubai, ourreal estate is not developed enough. Ourlegal structure is not that strong thatforeigners would find a comfort to comeand buy real estate in India. Right? Sowe have not made it like liberalized soto say. But when it comes to owningstocks in India, a lot of foreign wealthin the form of FDI and FIS come throughIndian stock market. But China has noreason to play this game. And it's notgovernment's focus to pump up its stockmarket. So then comes the third reasonthat okay fine this is the situationright now but what about like in thefuture what if China becomes like the USbecause they are literally like numberone economy right now in PPP terms by2035 they are going to overtake the USwhen it comes to their economy. Soduring that stage what happens right Imean would they become like the US? theywill only become like the US due to thisthird reason which is called as that ifprivate investors find value in theirmarket. Now for example when investorslike you and me go and buy US stockslike Google, Amazon, all thesecompanies, we have that comfort that USis capitalistic in nature and they valuefree markets. There's a lot of publicinformation about these companies. Thereis conference calls that you can trust.You can trust the US government thatokay, they will not kill this freemarket spirit. Be it like Donald Trump,beat it like anyone else, etc., etc. Butwhen it comes to China, there is a lotof opakeness. For example, if you studysome of the top private companies,example, Huawei or Deep Seek, they areleading the tech innovation in China.But is there a way for you to invest?Not really. These are unlistedcompanies. You can't really put money asa foreigner. Even when companies likeAlibaba which were doing exceptionallywell their founders used to speaksomething against the Chinese governmentand one day Jackmar got captured orwhatever right so long story shortinvestors or foreign investors do notfind that comfort in terms of investingmoney due to this randomness in themarket. Now then comes the fourth pointas to why the China market does not dowell and this has to do with domesticinvestments. For example, take a look atthis chart and what you will see is thatChinese investors or almost 65% ofwealth in China is logged into realestate. This is more than that in India.This is more than that in US. This ismore than that in Singapore. Theirequity adoption is very very less tobegin with. Now you would say that okayin India also it is like 7 to 10% orwhatever it is like this is verysimilar. But see China's economy ishuge. They have something called asdepth of market. For example, in the US,if you have to go and pick like 50 goodcompanies that you can buy, you caneasily do it. But you can't possibly dothat in India that easily becauseIndia's market depth is not that much.So therefore, this comparison of 7 to10% adoption in India versus China isnot really apples to apples because inIndia's case, the hope is that as oureconomy grows, our markets will becomedeeper, right? Like the US. Now just torecap all four reasons. Number onereason is that China is a net exporterand in the future also it's continue tobe a net exporter. It is going togenerate that foreign wealth or bringforeign wealth into China in the longterm using this strategy. This strategyis working well for it. So there is noreason why China will change this.Number two is that government is capableenough in China to actually export stuffbring foreign wealth in. So there is noneed for them to go through the stockmarket route to bring foreign wealth.Number three, private investors do notfind exit. So for example, if I am aninternational investor, I will not go toChina, put my money with the hope thatone day I'll get an exit. Now, finalreason is that the domestic playersthere, they do not speculate in theChina market yet. Now, will thisspeculation come in the near future? Idon't know. I don't see it. So, what ismy verdict? Right? Is it great to investin the Chinese market right now? Shortanswer is no. This is not a buy and holdmarket. If you want to flip or trade thechannel for example I was one of theearly guys right on the Indian YouTubecommunity who bought something called asHansen index I'm exiting that whybecause Chinese market is very cyclicalright so this cycle is unlikely tochange we are unlikely to see likesomething like this happening unless ofcourse China decides to pivot and ifthey do decide to pivot it would befairly obvious I'll make an updatedvideo but as of now there is noindication that why China would pivotthen comes a natural second questionthat Then in that circumstances whichother market can we consider? Well, Iwould still encourage you to study theUS market. One of the key reasons whythat is there is something called asfrontier tech companies that are comingup. For example, in my portfolio, I havepicked companies like Bean therapeutics.These are all crisper technology basedcompanies. If you want to invest in theprivate market like Stripe or OpenAI,even that is a possibility in the US.Nvidia, AMD, I mean I had been speakingquite aggressively about it. I myselfhave put like a lot of money into thatand this entire portfolio. You can checkit here. In case you guys are keen, youcan join my community. I talk about USstock investing in a very strategicviewpoint. I talk about everyday betsthat I'm taking. So you will learn howto cultivate build your own portfolio. Ialso do classes every month. So in caseyou guys are keen or are a serious USstock investor, definitely considerchecking out my community. The reviewshave been excellent. The portfolioperformance has been excellent. Sodefinitely check it out. But long storyshort, at least learn about somethingcalled as frontier tech because many ofyou give me the problem statement thathey I want to invest for 5 10 years.Tell me where can I invest here. Right?So frontier tech companies is what youneed to pick. Next robotics, next bigsemiconductor company, next big datacenter. All this is coming from Chinaand the US. But China very opaque, hardto invest. US still a very goodpossibility. Second is UAE basedcompanies. I'm quite bullish. I havestarted to put a little bit of money inUAE based companies. In fact, I'm aregistered finance influencer in UAEnow. You can check it here. I will speakmore about UAE stocks as well. I feelthat UAE stocks are going to do well.Why? Because UAE itself is expanding.UAE is very investor friendly. They havedemonstrated that in their real estateand at some point this is going to comeand reflect in the stock markets also.So therefore I am bullish on UAE. Andthe third major geography where I ambullish on is Latin America, Latincountries, right? So I have addedcompanies like NU bank, right? And Ihave added companies like Mercado,Libre. Now these companies are gainingadoption. Latin American market is likethe Indian market, right? Maybe likeminus 5 years, right? There was a lot offintech adoption that happened in theIndian market. Something similar isgoing to happen in Latin Americanmarkets. So therefore, I am bullishabout these three markets. SoutheastAsia is also on my radar. I'm studyingmore about Southeast Asia, countrieslike Vietnam, countries like Thailand,they are also doing fairly well due toproxy China trade, right? And thesecountries might open up due to lessstringent political regimes so to say.So let's wait and watch. I'm not makingany decision there. I'm studying moreand I'll continue to evolve my theory.So yeah, so India continues to be a goodmarket. You guys are already might beinvesting, but these are some othermarkets that you could consider.
